# 👋🏽 Hello there! 

I'm an aspiring data analyst thrilled to share my journey with you. Let me give you a glimpse into who I am and what I bring to the table.

## Background:
📜 Picture the edgy student in class who rocked flannel shirts, or occasionally all black, but was easy to get along with. That was me and a bit still am! I bring a unique blend of creativity and approachability to the table, making collaboration a breeze. I thrive on brainstorming innovative ideas and bringing them to life in analytical projects. With a Bachelor's in Psychology, specializing in research and experimentation, I've developed my skills in understanding human behavior and biology while delving into and utilizing data analytics. My journey started with a focus on market research and the healthcare industry, where I learned to dissect data and draw meaningful insights. As a Tableau Desktop Specialist, I've also honed my skills in SQL and Python, making me versatile.

## Skills:
✨ I've constantly fueled my enthusiasm for learning by diving headfirst into various technologies and sciences. In 2020, I embarked on a journey to learn Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Over that following year, I delved deeper into Python, exploring Sklearn, Seaborn, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodel, and Numpy. Recently, I completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate, equipping me with the knowledge and hands-on experience in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science.

## Interests:
🔬 Beyond the world of data, I'm a multifaceted individual with diverse interests. From drawing to creative writing, I love exploring new skills. My creative side was put to use during market research, where I crafted and tested a product through statistical analyses and surveys. I've also embarked on learning the German language, reaching a commendable level of comprehension. Then, to top all of this off, I've had three novellas published online in the horror genre.

## Motivation:
🎯 I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep love for learning. Topics like medical science, human behavior, cultures, customs, and marketing intrigue me, especially when they involve data. Analyzing and understanding data findings allows me to craft meaningful stories and insights. I'm passionate about unraveling the secrets hidden within data.

## Call to action:
📧 I'm excited and open to new opportunities in the field of data analytics. Whether you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration, tackle a project, or just have a friendly chat, feel free to reach out to me at alewi@umich.edu. I'm eager to connect and explore the endless possibilities that data analytics has to offer. Let's undertake this data-driven adventure together!

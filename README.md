# 👋 Hello there!
## 🔬About Me
👀 I am Nero Lewis, a Tableau Desktop Specialist (specializing in Python and SQL too), pursuing a role in Data Analytics with a Bachelor's in Psychology (specializing in research and experimentation). I am new to GitHub and cannot wait to learn more.

🎆 I enjoy contributing and providing innovative ideas to analytical projects, and I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and sciences. In 2020, I learned the data analytical process as well as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Within the following year, I dove deeper into Python, learning Sklearn, Seaborn, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodel, and Numpy. Currently, I completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate, which comprised 7 courses on statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science.

💞️ Aside from technology and science, I am passionate about developing new skills from drawing to creative writing. These were used when I had taken market research in which I created a product, having tested it via various statistical analyses and surveys before deployment, and did an internship in human resources. I also  took to learning the German language, where I reached level three in language comprehension.

❤️ Learning and reading new concepts are a passion of mine such as reading medical science, human nature/behaviors, cultures, and customs, as well as marketing. These topics are especially engaging for me when it involves data, giving me the chance to analyze and understand findings on a deeper level to derive insight to create a meaningful story. 

📫 If you want to reach me, use my email, alewi@umich.edu. I look forward to hearing from you.

# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! 

I'm a data analyst thrilled to share my journey with you. Let me give you a glimpse into who I am and what I bring to the table.

## Background:
ðŸ“œ Imagine the student who wore flannel or all blackâ€”edgy but approachable. That was me, and in many ways, still is. I bring a mix of creativity, curiosity, and collaboration to every project, thriving in environments where ideas are exchanged freely and brought to life through data. Pursuing a Master's in Data Science and holding a Bachelor's in Psychology focused on research and industry/organization, I developed a strong foundation in understanding human behavior, business, and marketing analysis. My career began in market research and healthcare, where I learned to extract meaningful insights from complex data. Since then, I've expanded my toolkitâ€”earning a Tableau Desktop Specialist certification and building proficiency in SQL and Pythonâ€”making me a well-rounded and adaptable data analyst.

## Skills:
âœ¨ I've constantly fueled my enthusiasm for learning by diving headfirst into various technologies and sciences. In 2020, I embarked on a journey to learn Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Over that following year, I delved deeper into Python, exploring Sklearn, Seaborn, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodel, and Numpy. Recently, I completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate, equipping me with the knowledge and hands-on experience in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science.

## Interests:
ðŸ”¬ Beyond the world of data, I'm a multifaceted individual with diverse interests. From drawing to creative writing, I love exploring new skills. My creative side was put to use during market research, where I crafted and tested a product through statistical analyses and surveys. I've also embarked on learning the German language, reaching a commendable level of comprehension. Then, to top all of this off, I've had three novellas published online in the horror genre.

## Motivation:
ðŸŽ¯ I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep love for learning. Topics like medical science, human behavior, cultures, customs, and marketing intrigue me, especially when they involve data. Analyzing and understanding data findings allows me to craft meaningful stories and insights. I'm passionate about unraveling the secrets hidden within data.

## Call to action:
ðŸ“§ I'm excited and open to new opportunities in the field of data analytics. Whether you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration, tackle a project, or just have a friendly chat, feel free to reach out to me at alewi@umich.edu. I'm eager to connect and explore the endless possibilities that data analytics has to offer. Let's undertake this data-driven adventure together!

# 👋 Hello there!
## 🔬About Me
👀 I am Nero Lewis, a Tableau Desktop Specialist (specializing in Python and SQL too), pursuing a role in Data Analytics with a Bachelor's in pstchology (specializing in research and experimentation). I am new to GitHub and cannot wait to learn more.

🎆 I enjoy contributing and providing innovative ideas to analytical projects, and I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and sciences. In 2020, I learned the data analytical process as well as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Within the following year, I dove deeper into Python, learning Sklearn, Seaborn, Pandas and Numpy. Currently, I am learning artificial neural networking.

💞️ Aside from tech and science, I am passionate about developing new skills from drawing to creative writing. The German language is my most recent venture, where I reached level three in class level.

❤️ I also enjoy learning and reading new concepts such as medical science, human nature/behaviors, cultures and customs, as well as marketing.
